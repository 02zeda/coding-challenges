# coding-challenges
A repository of coding challenges that I am working on. These coding challenges can be completed in almost any programming language, and is inteded to be used to improve skills in a particular programming language and programming in general.

The challenges can be found at [https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) 
## Why does this repository exist?
This repository serves as a personal learning log, where I can track my progress as I solve a variety of coding problems and improve my problem-solving abilities. Starting with **C**, 
I am working through these challenges to build a solid foundation in programming fundamentals, memory management, and algorithmic thinking. It is also an opportunity for me to apply 
what I have learned during my studies as a software engineer at Blekinge Institute of Technology. As I progress, I plan to revisit some of the same challenges using different programming 
languages to deepen my understanding and versatility in coding



## 🚀 Goals

1. **Strengthen Programming Foundations**: Practice essential programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
2. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Solve the same challenges across various programming languages to understand language-specific strengths and limitations.
3. **Document Growth**: Showcase my development in both coding proficiency and solution efficiency over time.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, with each language containing folders for individual challenges. Within each challenge folder, you'll find:
- The solution code for that language
- A README file with problem details, solution approaches, and key learnings

## 📝 Challenges Overview
Here is a summary of the challenges I have completed or are currently working on, the concepts covered in the challenge and the language used:
|  Challenge  |  Language  |  Concepts Covered   |  Status  |
|  ---------- |  --------- |  ------------------ |  ------- |
| Building wc |     C      | File IO, command line options and arguments    | Completed|

## 📚 Progress Log
### Completed C challenges
- Building wc
  - Status: Completed
  - Reflection: This challenge gave me practical experience in reading charactes from files and how one can read from stdin and how reading options from the commandline is done in the best in C. It also thought me about writing maintainable code, since I did not look at the last steps of the challenge. This made me have to rewrite some of my code.
