This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool sort!

It sounds like a simple utility, but if you build everything in this challenge you’ll be using five different sorting algorithms and at least three different data structures.

The Unix command line tools are a great metaphor for good software engineering and they follow the Unix Philosophies of:

    Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
    Design programs to be connected to other programs - each tool can be easily connected to other tools to create incredibly powerful compositions.
    Design programs to be connected to other programs - each tool can be easily connected to other tools, via files and streams, to create incredibly powerful compositions.

Following these philosophies has made the simple unix command line tools some of the most widely used software engineering tools which can be chained together to create far more complex and powerful set of tools that you’d expect.
