# JSON Parser in C
I have some prior experiences with compiler concepts such as lexical analysis and syntactical analysis from a course I partook in compiler technology, so the concepts needed are not completely foreign to me. I have not, however, finished that course at the time of writing. That is why I think doing this challenge could be helpful for me to get into that headspace again. With that said, below you will find some learning outcomes I hope to gain from this project.

## Learning Outcomes
I will divide the types of outcomes into some different categories to make it simpler for myself and others who may read this.
- Programming: This type of outcome will help me with being more proficient in solving problems and writing code in C.
- Process: What I mean by a process learning outcome is how go about solving the problem itself or rather the way I develop the solution.
- Pipeline: The learing outcomes from how I can setup testing, running my project in a container and setting up github actions for example.


### Programming
- Unit testing in C
- knowledge of error handling
-  knowledge of file handling
- Using and implementing data structures and algorithms in C
### Process
- basic knowledge of implementing test-driven development
- Improved documentation and writing skills
### Pipeline
- Know how to setup a multistage build process
- automated testing using docker
- basic understanding of using github actions

## Step zero
As you already know, I have chosen C as my programming language for this challenge. For this step I will setup a docker compose file and a docker file for running my project as well as the basic files where I will implement my solution. By the end of this step, I will:

- Be able to run my project in a docker container.
- Be able to automatically run tests for the project.
- Know how to do tests in C.
- Have setup all the initial source files.
